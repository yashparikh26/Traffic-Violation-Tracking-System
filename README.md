# Traffic Violation Tracking System using CCTV Cameras

## Project Overview
This project presents an automated traffic violation tracking system designed to support traffic authorities using CCTV-based monitoring. The project focuses on system architecture, violation detection workflow, and centralized data management for effective traffic enforcement in urban environments.

## Motivation
Manual traffic monitoring is difficult to scale and often results in missed violations and delayed enforcement. With increasing traffic density, there is a need for automated systems that can assist authorities in monitoring, recording, and analyzing traffic violations in a reliable and transparent manner.

## System Concept
The proposed system continuously processes CCTV footage to identify traffic rule violations. Once detected, vehicle information is extracted and violation details are recorded along with supporting evidence. The system minimizes manual intervention while ensuring accuracy and accountability.

## Key Functional Components
- Continuous CCTV-based traffic surveillance  
- Automated detection of traffic rule violations  
- License plate recognition for vehicle identification  
- Evidence capture with time, date, and location  
- Centralized database for violation records

- The system includes a simple web-based interface to support system usage.  
Key features include:
- Dashboard view of detected traffic violations  
- Access to violation details and supporting evidence  
- Report viewing for authorized personnel  
- User access to view violation status and payment details

 The web interface acts as a visualization and access layer, while the core system handles detection, storage, and processing.

## System Design and Architecture
The project is designed using UML diagrams including use case, class, sequence, activity, and component diagrams. These models clearly describe interactions between cameras, processing modules, databases, and users, ensuring a modular and scalable system design.

## Data Management and Reporting
All violation data is stored in a centralized repository, enabling structured reporting and traffic behavior analysis. Reports help identify frequent violations, peak times, and high-risk locations.
